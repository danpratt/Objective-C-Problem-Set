# Objective-C Problem Set

![Platform iOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/nanodegree-iOS-blue.svg)

This repository contains starter code for the Objective-C Problem Set project, also called the Common Interoperability Challenges, in Udacity's iOS Nanodegree.

## Overview

The Objective-C Problem Set is a collection of iOS applications and code challenges that use Objective-C and Swift. There is also a simple "Hot Tub" example to get you started:

```

```

## Setup

Several of the projects in the problem set do not build immediately. It is advised that you follow the instructions provided in the classroom.
